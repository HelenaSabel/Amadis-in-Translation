            <p><s>Fifteen days <persName ref="#Galaor">Galaor</persName> abode in the monastery before his wounds were healed; then he
                  departed, and rode where chance guided him.</s><s>About midday he came to a
                  fountain in a valley, and by the fountain was an armed Knight, having no horse,
                  nor other beast.</s><s>Marvelling thereat, Galaor said to him, <milestone unit="said" ana="start" resp="#Galaor"/>Sir Knight, how
                  came you thus afoot?<milestone unit="said" ana="end"/></s><s>The Knight answered, <milestone unit="said" ana="start" resp="#anon"/>in riding toward my castle I fell
                  in with fellows who slew my horse, so that I must walk home, though sorely tired,
                  for my people know not my case.<milestone unit="said" ana="end"/></s><s><milestone unit="said" ana="start" resp="#Galaor"/>Not so,<milestone unit="said" ana="intStart"/> replied Galaor, <milestone unit="said" ana="intEnd"/>you shall have my
                     Squire’s beast.<milestone unit="said" ana="end"/></s><s><milestone unit="said" ana="start" resp="#anon"/>I thank you, Sir,<milestone unit="said" ana="intStart"/> quoth the Knight; <milestone unit="said" ana="intEnd"/>but, before we
                  depart hence, you shall know the virtue of this fountain, which is such that no
                  poison, however strong, hath any force against the water.</s><s>Beasts that have
                  been poisoned immediately recover by drinking here, and all the people of the
                  district come hither, and find relief for their infirmities.<milestone unit="said" ana="end"/></s><s><milestone unit="said" ana="start" resp="#Galaor"/>In sooth you
                     tell me wonders,<milestone unit="said" ana="intStart"/> said Galaor, <milestone unit="said" ana="intEnd"/>and I will alight and taste it.<milestone unit="said" ana="end"/></s><s>The Knight
                        replied, <milestone unit="said" ana="start" resp="#anon"/>good reason you should, being near that which you ought to seek from
                        afar.<milestone unit="said" ana="end"/></s></p>

            <p><s>Galaor dismounted, and bade his Squire alight and drink as he did, and he placed
                  his arms against a tree.</s><s>Go and drink, said the Knight, and I will hold your
                  horse; and, while they were drinking, he put on Galaor’s helmet, took his lance,
                  and mounted and rode away, saying, farewell, Sir Knight, you must stay here till
                  you trick another as I have tricked you.</s><s>Ah, knave, quoth Galaor, thou shalt
                  repent this!</s><s>You must provide yourself with horse and arms first, said the
                  traitor.</s></p>

            <p><s>Gone is the Knight so fast as he could gallop, and Galaor in great wrath followed
                  in the same tract upon the Squire’s palfrey.</s><s>At length he came to a double
                  way, and knowing not which to take, stood still in perplexity.</s><s>Presently
                  there came up a Damsel, riding more than apace, of whom he demanded if she had
                  seen a Knight on a bay horse, bearing a white shield with a vermilion flower. –
                  And what would you with him?</s><s>I would recover my horse and arms which he has
                  stolen; and he told her what had happened.</s><s>How, said she, would you recover
                  them being disarmed?</s><s>Only let me find him!</s><s>quoth Galaor. – Well, grant
                  me a boon, and I will bring you to him.</s><s>So she rode on, and Galaor after
                  her; but the Damsel was foremost, for Galaor’s palfrey could not keep up with her,
                  carrying both him and his Squire, and they rode three leagues without seeing
                  her.</s><s>Then they met her returning, for the false Knight was her paramour, and
                  she had been advising with him how he might spoil Galaor of his armour.</s><s>So
                  she led Galaor to a tent, where the Knight was ready to kill him without
                  danger.</s><s>Galaor alighted; the Knight stood at the entrance of the tent, and
                  exclaimed, give me now the rest of your armour, or I will slay thee!</s><s>Certes,
                  quoth Galaor, I cannot fear such a knave as thou art; and, avoiding his blow, he
                  smote him so manfully upon the head as made him put knee to earth, and then griped
                  his helmet and plucked it off; and the Knight cried aloud to his leman for
                  help.</s><s>She hastily drawing nigh, called to Galaor to hold, for that was the
                  boon which she required; but she spoke too late, for Galaor in his anger had
                  already made him in a state that needed no surgeon.</s><s>Wretch that I
                  am!</s><s>said she, in beguiling another I have deceived myself.</s><s>An ill
                  death kill thee, Knight!</s><s>I will claim thy boon so that thou shalt die for
                  it; and, if thou shouldst refuse to grant it, I will every where proclaim thee and
                  shame thee.</s><s>Damsel, said Galaor, you spoke too late, else would I have
                  spared him, though he well deserved death.</s><s>Then mounting, he rode
                  on.</s><s>After some time he looked and saw that she was following him; whither go
                  you?</s><s>said he. – In your company, which I win not leave, till I have found
                  opportunity to demand my boon, and make thee die an evil death. – Lady, you had
                  better choose some other atonement. – Nothing but thy life for his.</s><s>So they
                  rode on for three days; the Damsel perpetually reviling him, and then they entered
                  the forest of Angaduza.</s></p>

            <p><s>After Amadis had taken leave of Urganda’s Damsels, about noon he left the forest,
                  and came out upon a plain, wherein there was a goodly Castle, and in the plain
                  there was a chariot, the richest that ever he saw, drawn by twelve palfreys, and
                  covered with crimson sattin, so that he could see nothing within.</s><s>The
                  chariot was guarded by eight Knights on each side.</s><s>As Amadis approached to
                  see what it might be, one of the Knights bade him keep off.</s><s>I have no ill
                  intent, said Amadis.</s><s>Be that as it may, quoth the Knight, you shall not
                  approach.</s><s>You are not such that you ought to see what goes there; and, if
                  you persist, you must do battle with us.</s><s>Each singly would be enough, how
                  much more all together!</s><s>Then he of Gaul took his arms, and sped so well that
                  there soon remained only one enemy to deal with; his helmet he smote off, and when
                  Amadis saw under it the face of an old man, and the grey hairs, he drew
                  back.</s><s>Sir Knight, quoth he, you should now leave this pursuit, for if you
                  have not before won honour, your age excuses you now.</s><s>Nay, friend, replied
                  the old Knight, the young must fight to obtain renown, and the old to preserve
                  what they have won.</s><s>Your words, Sir Knight, are wiser than mine, said
                  Amadis; and he advanced to the chariot, and lifted up the hangings: within it he
                  saw a marble monument, having the figure of a crowned King thereon in royal robes,
                  but the crown was cleft to the head, and the head down to the neck.</s><s>There
                  was also a Dame sitting on a couch, and by her a young Maiden of most excellent
                  beauty.</s><s>I pray ye tell me, Madam, said he, what figure is this.</s><s>She
                  seeing that he was not of her company, replied, who gave thee permission to look
                  here? – None other than my desire thus to do. – And my Knights, what did
                  they?</s><s>More harm to me than good, said Amadis.</s><s>Then the Lady in years
                  [Transcriber’s note: tears?] lifted the curtain and saw her Knights, some lying
                  dead, some endeavouring to catch their horses, and she was greatly moved, and said
                  to Amadis, cursed be the hour in which thou, who hast done such devilries, wert
                  born!</s><s>Lady, he replied, your Knights attacked me.</s><s>I beseech you tell
                  me the meaning of this. – As God shall help me, you shall never learn it from me
                  whom you have so injured.</s><s>And when Amadis beheld how wroth she was, he
                  departed and went his way.</s></p>

            <p><s>The Knights of the Lady then placed their dead comrades in the chariot, and went
                  towards the Castle with great shame.</s><s>Amadis meantime rode on, and when he
                  had gone about a league, he saw the old Knight riding after him, who called to him
                  to stop.</s><s>The Lady whom you saw, said he, sends to you, and requests you will
                  lodge in her Castle to-night, that she may make amends for her
                  discourtesy.</s><s>Gentle Sir, quoth Amadis, she was so moved that meseems my
                  presence should cause her more wrath than pleasure.</s><s>Believe me, answered the
                  Knight, she will rejoice in your return.</s><s>Amadis seeing the Knight was of an
                  age that should not lie, and won by his manner, turned back with him.</s><s>On the
                  way he asked the meaning of the figure, but the Knight would not resolve him; and
                  when they drew near the Castle, the old man rode on to inform his Lady of her
                  guest.</s><s>Amadis slowly followed to the gate, over which there was a tower, and
                  he saw the Lady and the young Damsel at one of the tower windows, and the Lady
                  said to him, Enter, Sir Knight, for we greatly rejoice at your coming.</s><s>He
                  answered, Lady, I rejoice to obey rather than displease you; and entered the
                  Castle.</s><s>Presently there was a great stir within, and many Knights and armed
                  men came out and beset him, crying, yield or thou art dead!</s><s>Certes, quoth
                  he, I will not willingly enter the prison of such false ones!</s><s>and with that
                  he laced his helm; but his shield he could not take, because of the press there
                  was upon him.</s><s>They struck at him on all sides; he nevertheless worthily
                  defended himself so long as his horse could stand, felling at his feet all whom he
                  could reach with a fair blow; but his horse being slain, and he himself sorely
                  prest, he made toward a shed which was in the court, and there by the wall
                  defended himself to better advantage.</s><s>Gandalin and the Dwarf were taken in
                  his sight, which the more inflamed him; but his enemies were so many, and laid on
                  such heavy load, that sometimes he was upon his knees, and he saw no way of
                  escaping death, and they would shew him no mercy, because he had slain and
                  grievously wounded so many.</s><s>But God and his own worth succoured him in this
                  peril.</s><s>The young Damsel beheld the battle, and seeing his brave behaviour
                  she was moved to pity, and calling to one of her women, she said, I had rather all
                  my people were slain than that good Knight should perish – follow me!</s><s>Lady,
                  said the woman, what would you do?</s><s>Let my lions loose upon his enemies, said
                  she, and I command you being my vassal to release them, for you can do it because
                  they know you.</s><s>Upon this the woman loosed the chain of the lions, who were
                  two in number and very fierce, and then she cried out, save yourselves, for the
                  lions have broke loose!</s><s>They who were besetting Amadis forthwith fled, yet
                  not so lightly but that many of them were torn to pieces by the beasts.</s><s>But
                  Amadis immediately made for the gate as well as he could, and going out closed it
                  behind him, and fastened the lions in the court.</s><s>Then he seated himself upon
                  a stone, sore wearied as one who had fought hardly, still holding in his hand his
                  sword which was broken.</s></p>

            <p><s>The lions meantime having scoured the court, ran here and there, and would fain
                  have escaped thro’ the grate.</s><s>The people of the Castle dared not descend to
                  them, nor she who had let them loose, for they were too fierce to be
                  controlled.</s><s>In this distress, not knowing how to help themselves, they
                  agreed that their mistress should ask Amadis to open the gate, which perhaps he
                  might do at a Lady’s request.</s><s>Full loth was she to ask him, considering how
                  little she had deserved such favour at his hands; yet, knowing it was her last
                  refuge, she looked from the window and said, Sir Knight, however hardly we have
                  dealt with you, let your courtesy exceed our demerit, open the gate that the lions
                  may go out and we may be safe.</s><s>We will make what amends we can for the past,
                  and on my faith I assure you my intent was only to hold you as my prisoner, till
                  you would consent to be my Knight.</s><s>Amadis mildly answered, that should have
                  been gained in another guise: I would willingly have become your Knight to do you
                  service, as I am the Knight of all Dames and Damsels who, need it. – And will you
                  not open the gate? – No!</s><s>as God shall help me you shall not receive that
                  courtesy from me.</s><s>With that she went from the window lamenting, and the fair
                  young maiden said to him, Sir Knight, there are those here who had no part in the
                  wrong which has been done you, and who deserve some favour at your
                  hands.</s><s>Then Amadis greatly admiring her, answered, fair friend, do you wish
                  me to open the gate?</s><s>I should thank you earnestly, said she; and seeing
                  Amadis rise to do it, she stopt him, saying, stay a moment while I make the Lady
                  secure your safety.</s><s>So that he marvelled at her discretion.</s><s>The Lady
                  then warranted him that he should be safe from her people, and promised to release
                  to him Gandalin and the Dwarf, and the old Knight bade him take a mace and shield
                  to kill the lions as they came out.</s><s>Give me the arms!</s><s>said Amadis; but
                  God forsake me if I do harm to those who have aided me so well.</s><s>Certes, Sir
                  Knight, quoth the old man, you will not fail in your faith to man, since you keep
                  it so to beasts.</s><s>Then they threw to him the mace and shield, and Amadis took
                  them, and sheathed the little of his sword that was left, and opened the gate,
                  being ready with the mace in his own defence.</s><s>Immediately the lions ran by
                  him into the open country.</s><s>He entered the court, and presently the Lady and
                  her people came to receive him, and they brought him Gandalin and the
                  Dwarf.</s><s>I have lost my horse here, said Amadis; if it please you, Lady, give
                  me another, else I must depart on foot.</s><s>That, quoth she, were sbame for a
                  Knight like you; but remain here this night, and on the morrow we will provide you
                  a horse.</s><s>Then they disarmed him, and brought him a costly mantle, and led
                  him to the apartment where the Lady and the young Damsel expected him, and they
                  seeing him so young and beautiful, being so brave a Knight, were greatly
                  amazed.</s><s>He on his part no less wondered at the Damsel, how fair she was; but
                  addressing the Lady, he said, if it please you, tell me what the figure meant
                  which I saw in the chariot.</s><s>She replied, promise me to do what you ought
                  after having heard it, and I will tell you; otherwise, I pray you hold me
                  excused.</s><s>It were no reason, Madam, quoth Amadis, to promise lightly I know
                  not what: if it be to do what befits a Knight, I shall not fail you.</s><s>You say
                  well, Sir, said she; and then dismissing all her attendants, she began.</s></p>

            <p><s>Sir Knight, that figure in stone is made in remembrance of the father of this fair
                  maiden, who lies in the monument which you saw in the chariot.</s><s>He was a
                  crowned King, and being upon his throne on a festival day his brother came up, and
                  drawing a sword from under his cloak, smote him on the head and cleft it, as you
                  saw in the statue.</s><s>This was a concerted treason; he had brought with him
                  many adherents, and seized the kingdom, which he still holds.</s><s>This child,
                  the only one of the murdered King, was then under the care of that old Knight whom
                  you have seen; who fled with her to me, being her aunt.</s><s>I procured my
                  brother’s body, and entombed it as you have seen, and every day it is laid in the
                  chariot, and carried forth; and I have sworn that none should see the monument but
                  those who attain the sight by arms, nor leaving seen it, learn the meaning without
                  promising to take vengeance for so wicked a treason.</s><s>Now, if you be a noble
                  Knight bound to prosecute virtue, and on so just occasion, you will employ the
                  forces God hath lent ye in this right cause; and I will continue this course,
                  being sure of you, till I have found two champions more, to fight with the traitor
                  and his two sons, for they will not undertake the battle except they be
                  together.</s></p>

            <p><s>Let them come one, by one, said Amadis, and I will singly cope with
                  them.</s><s>That, quoth she, they will never consent to; but do you return here at
                  a year’s end, and I will have the other two champions ready.</s><s>I will not
                  fail, answered Amadis; and do not you trouble yourself in that search, for I will
                  bring those with me who shall well maintain your right.</s><s>This he said
                  trusting in that time to meet his brother Galaor and Agrayes.</s><s>They heartily
                  thanking him, bade him besure they were good Knights, for that wicked King and his
                  sons were some of the strongest Knights in the world.</s><s>If I find but one of
                  those whom I look for, said he, I shall not care for a third, however strong they
                  may be.</s><s>Tell us then, gentle Sir, of what country you are, and where we may
                  find you? – I am of the house of Lisuarte, Queen Brisena’s Knight.</s><s>Now then,
                  let us go eat, said she, with the better appetite after this agreement.</s><s>Then
                  went they into a spacious hall, where such cheer and honour was made him as might
                  be desired till the hour of rest came.</s><s>The good night being given on all
                  sides, he was conducted to his chamber by the Damsel who had loosed the
                  lions.</s><s>Sir Knight, said she, there is one in this castle who helped you when
                  you knew it not. – And when was that? – When I set the lions loose to save you by
                  my young Lady’s order; for she pitied you: if she live, she will be without peer
                  for wisdom as well as beauty.</s><s>Of a truth, quoth Amadis, I believe so; but
                  tell her I truly thank her, and bid her think me her Knight.</s><s>She will gladly
                  hear me say so, replied the Damsel; and with that she departed, leaving Amadis in
                  bed.</s><s>All this Gandalin and the Dwarf heard, who lay in another bed at his
                  feet; and the Dwarf, who knew not of the loves of Amadis and Oriana, thought that
                  he loved the young Maiden, and had therefore called himself her Knight, and sorely
                  did Amadis suffer afterwards for this error.</s></p>

            <p><s>In the morning after mass, Amadis asked the names of those with whom he was to do
                  battle.</s><s>The father, said the Lady, is called Abiseos, the sons Darasion and
                  Dramis, all three of great prowess.</s><s>And where do they reign?</s><s>In
                  Sobradisa, which borders upon Serolis, and on the other side is bounded by the
                  sea.</s><s>He then armed himself and mounted, and was about to take his leave,
                  when the young Damsel came to him, bringing a rich sword which had been her
                  father’s.</s><s>Sir Knight, said she, use this sword while it may last you, for my
                  sake, and God prosper you therewith.</s><s>Amadis received it with a smile: hold
                  me, Lady, for your Knight!</s><s>Certes, Lady, quoth the Dwarf, you gain not a
                  little in gaining such a Knight.</s></p>
