            <p><s>As this Damsel was of quick mind herself, and now guided by the grace of God, she determined to have the remedy ready before the need; and it was in this guise: she took four boards and with them made an ark large enough to contain a new born child and its garments, and long enough for the sword, she fastened them together with bitumen in such sort, as the water should have no place to enter.</s><s>She hid all this under her bed till she had compleated it; and it was even and close as if a master had made it.</s><s>Then she showed it to Elisena and asked for what she thought it was designed?</s><s>She answered, <milestone unit="said" ana="start" resp="#Helisena"/>I know not.<milestone unit="said" ana="end"/></s><s><milestone unit="said" ana="start" resp="#Darioleta"/>You shall know,<milestone unit="said" ana="intStart"/> said the Damsel, <milestone unit="said" ana="intEnd"/>when need is.<milestone unit="said" ana="end"/></s><s>Elisena replied, <milestone unit="said" ana="start" resp="#Helisena"/>but little do I care to know what is done or what is said, for I am near to lose all my joy and comfort.<milestone unit="said" ana="end"/></s><s>Then had Darioleta great grief, and she went apart not bearing to see her mistress weep.</s></p>
